## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Throughout the resolution of this exercise I was able to obtain more knowledge about certain tags that increase semantics:

```html
<time datetime="09-12-2018">The most beautiful final of the world</time>
<time datetime="P7D">7 Days</time> <!-- Samara say>
   ```
> "The use of the time tag allows us to define dates, hours or periods"

```html
<data class="price" value="500,000">500</data>
   ```
> "I discovered the data element and it seemed appropriate to use it for prices"




### Continued development
  I plan to study more about regular expressions for use in inputs
